# CorgiStocks
This is a project that was finished during Tartanhacks, and it was basically a stock price predictor for visually impaired users. My team an I collected articles from
famous publishers and decided if stock price for certain company will increase or decrease based on those articles, using Google API that outputs whether some text is
negatively inclined or positively inclined.
